# Luis Gonzalez - Developer Portfolio 🎮

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
I’m a passionate developer based in Canada, currently finishing my DEC in Computer Programming.  
Even though I’m just completing my formal studies, my journey into the world of technology began over 10 years ago. Since then, I’ve explored and practiced various aspects of game development, including **programming, gameplay systems, storytelling, character and level design**, using both **pixel art and 3D workflows**. I made a lot of small projects in web developping.

While these were not always full-scale projects, they were **focused experiments and practice sessions** aimed at learning specific disciplines within game and software development. Below are some of the tools and engines I’ve worked with:
